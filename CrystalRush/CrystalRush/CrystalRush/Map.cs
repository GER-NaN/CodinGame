        The game is played on a grid 30 cells wide by 15 cells high. The coordinates x=0, y=0 corresponds to the top left cell.
        The first column of cells is considered to be part of the headquarters. This is where Crystal ore must be returned to once mined and where objects are requested.
        The cells that contain crystal ore are called vein cells. Veins are not visible to the players unless they are within the range of the player's radar. There are no vein cells in the headquarters.
        Robots can drill a hole on any cell (except the headquarters'). Holes are visible to both players and do not impede movement.
